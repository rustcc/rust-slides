# Strings in Rust

### Learn a bunch about strings

## `char`, the primitive character type

Rust has a primitive type for a single character, `char`.

```rust
let heart = '❤';
```

However, this isn't *technically* a character, but a [Unicode Scalar
Value](https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value). This means
that some things are a single `char`, but others aren't:

```rust
let eye_in_speech_bubble = '👁️‍🗨️';
```

```bash
error: character literal may only contain one codepoint
 --> src/main.rs:2:32
  |
2 |     let eye_in_speech_bubble = '👁️‍🗨️';
  |                                ^^^^
```

What looks like a character to you may not be one to Unicode. More on this later.
This also means that `char` is *always* four bytes, not one like in C.

# `&str` the primitive "string slice"

Rust also has a built-in string type: `&str`:

```rust
let s = "hello world";
```

`&str`s are immutable, and are, under the hood, a pointer to the start of the
string, and a length. This means we can slice up strings without allocating
new ones!

```rust
let s = "hello world";
let hello = &s[..5]; // "hello"
let world = &s[6..]; // "world"
```

Both `hello` and `world` are new `&str`s that refer to the first one, `s`.

> Note: A range like `..5` means "from the start to index 5" and one like
> `2..` means "from index 2 till the end".

# A bit about UTF-8

Strings in Rust are UTF-8 encoded, and contain a lot of Unicode-based functionality out of the box.

However, UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding. This means that a `&str` is **not** a list of `char`,
like you might assume at first. `char`s are four bytes each, so for example, consider this string:

```rust
let s = "hi";
```

Here's how it'd be laid out in memory, both as `&str` is, and if `&str` were made up of `char`s:

| index  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `&str` | h | i |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| `char` | 0 | 0 | 0 | h | 0 | 0 | 0 | i |

The `&str` is only two bytes, but the list of `char` would be eight!

### `String` is an owned mutable string

If you need to modify some string data, you'll want to create a `String`.

There are... a lot of ways to do this, as strings implement a ton of traits:

* `s.to_string()` is considered idiomatic, as it's very direct
* `String::from(s)` is sometimes used with literals, as it looks nicer
* `s.to_owned()` works too, as `String` is the owned variant of `&str`
* `s.into()` can work as well, since everything that implements `From` implements `Into`

```rust
// this works
let mut s = "hello".to_string();

// so does this
let mut s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(" world");

println!("{}", s); // prints "hello world";
```

Beware of the bikeshed!

# `String`s and capacity

While `&str`s are a pointer and a length, `String`s need to manage the memory they own,
and therefore are *three* `usize`s in size: a pointer, a length, and a capacity. This lets
a `String` request one big chunk of memory, so it doesn't need to allocate every time
it's modified.

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hi");

// prints 2 - 2
println!("{} - {}", s.len(), s.capacity());

s.push('!');

// prints 3 - 4; the capacity doubled!
println!("{} - {}", s.len(), s.capacity());

s.push('!');

// prints 4 - 4; no need to expand this time
println!("{} - {}", s.len(), s.capacity());
```

# `Deref` and strings

`String` implements `Deref<Target=str>`, which means that you can pass a `&String` to
something expecting a `&str`, and it will Just Work:

```rust
fn takes_str(s: &str) {
    // ...
}

let s = String::from("hello");

takes_str(&s);
```

Just throw an `&` on it!

## Accepting strings as a parameter

Given the `Deref` impl, you should generally accept `&str`s as arguments, so that
your users can use `&str`s and `String`s both. However, if you want to accept even
more types, and don't mind a complex type signature, you can use `AsRef`:

```rust
fn complicated<T>(s: T)
where
    T: AsRef<str>,
{
    let s = s.as_ref(); // s is a &str
}

let s = "hello";
complicated(s);

let s = String::from("hello");
complicated(s); // no need for the &
```

But this tradeoff isn't worth it most of the time.

# You can't index strings

Thanks to UTF-8 being variable-length, and the assumption that `[]` is always `O(1)`,
you can't use `[]` to access the nth character of a string or anything like that:

```rust
let s = "hi";

s[1]; // in some langauges, this is 'i'
```

```text
error[E0277]: the trait bound `str: std::ops::Index<{integer}>` is not satisfied
 --> src/main.rs:4:1
  |
4 | s[0];
  | ^^^^ the type `str` cannot be indexed by `{integer}`
```

You gotta decide if you want the nth byte, unicode scalar value, or grapheme cluster,
and then use the API for the correct one.

> Note: Grapheme cluster support isn't really in the standard library; check out
> the [`unicode-segmentation` crate](https://crates.io/crates/unicode-segmentation).

# Strings and `+`

Since `&str`s are immutable, and don't own their memory, you can't add two of
them with `+`:

```rust
let x = "hey " + "there";
```

```text
error[E0369]: binary operation `+` cannot be applied to type `&str`
```

It will work if the left hand side is a `String`; as then `+` takes
ownership, adds the right hand side to it, and then gives ownership back.
This can get tedious, especially if you're trying to chain `+`. Consider
`format!` instead:

```rust
let x = format!("{}{}{}", 1, 2, 3);
```

As a bonus, note that these numbers aren't strings; you don't need to stringify them first.
